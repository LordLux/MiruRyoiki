# MiruRyoiki
MiruRyoiki is a Flutter-based desktop application designed to help you seamlessly track and manage your local media library, primarily focusing on anime episodes. With MiruRyoiki, you can easily sync your progress with AniList, keeping your watched status up to date without hassle.

## Features:
### Manual & Automatic Episode Tracking:

- You can manually mark episodes as watched or let the app automatically detect the watched status via the MPCHC player.

- Support for other media players will be added in the future to expand compatibility.

### AniList Integration:

- AniList is the main focus of this app, providing smooth synchronization for anime tracking and management.

- MyAnimeList integration will be added once AniList support is fully implemented.

### Non-Anime Support:

- In addition to anime, MiruRyoiki also supports non-anime media tracking. However, non-anime content won't be synced with AniList or MyAnimeList.

## Upcoming Features:
- Expanded Player Support: Plans to include compatibility with additional media players.

- MyAnimeList Sync: After completing the AniList integration, MyAnimeList support will be introduced to extend the app's capabilities.
